Privacy Policy
Effective Date: [Insert Date]

1. Introduction
This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension (the "Extension") handles user data. We take privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring transparency regarding data collection and usage.

2. Data Collection and Usage
Our Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The only function of the Extension is to extract the URL of the website a user visits and copy it to their local clipboard. This allows users to paste the URL into other applications.

3. Data Storage and Sharing
The Extension does not store any data.
The Extension does not send any data to external servers, third parties, or cloud storage.
All operations are performed locally on the user's device.
4. Permissions
The Extension requires minimal permissions to function properly. The activeTab permission is used to read the URL of the currently active tab so it can be copied to the clipboard.

5. Security
Since our Extension does not collect or transmit any data, there is no risk of data breaches or leaks related to its functionality.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If there are any significant changes, we will update the Effective Date above.
